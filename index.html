        <p>I was born in South Korea and immigrated to the United States with my family in 2006. Since then, I've attended 7 different schools in the past 12 years. I graduated this past May as the valedictorian of my class. However, I had to take an unexpected gap year, so I decided to take this course to keep up with the rest of my peers who are first years at Georgia Tech.</p>
        <p>I took my first computer science class in my sophomore year of high school, and I was instantly hooked. Since then, I've "learned" Java, C, and Javascript in my classes, but never worked on any projects of my own. I hope to use what I learn through this class to find an internship in my first semester in the Fall.</p>
